This is simple implementation of tuio server/client on top of liblo
I have written this in order to use tuio protocol on flash based apps.
As flash doesn't support udp protocol this is only way aside xml-sockets,
which are on other hand much slower. For now the only known app that does
this kind of thing is flosc (which is java based and It's implementing xml-sockets,
so in other words much slower as this means that if you want to register events, 
you need to store a bunch of unnecessary data.)

Compiling:
on linux based machines its enough to do :
make all

Dependencies:
Only the liblo package (with dev package if your distro/system has that)

Licensing:
Im releasing this with GPL V2 or (at your option) any later version,
full license is included in GPL2 file.
