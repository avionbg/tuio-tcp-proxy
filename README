This is simple implementation of tuio server/client on top of liblo
I have written this to enable use of tuio protocol on flash based apps
as flash doesn't support udp protocol this is only way aside xml-sockets
which are on other hand much slower. For now only known app that does
this kind of thing is flosc (which is not suited to this at least on my
opinion as it's java based and It's implementing xml-sockets)
This means that if you want to register events, you need to store a bunch
of unnecessary data.

Compiling:
on linux based machines its enough to do make all

Dependencies:
Only the liblo package (with dev if your distro/system has that)

Licensing:
Im releasing this with GPL V2 or (at your option) any later version,
full license is included in GPL2 file.
